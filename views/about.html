<p> Hello my name is Cesar Salazar</p>
<br>
<p> I created Simple Games with a simple (pun intended) idea in mind <br>
to create awesome games people could enjoy in healthy competition </p>

<p> I'm an inspiring web developer and this is one of the first websites I have ever built. I used node.js for the server side and good old plain html/css/js for the frontend. <br> If you are interested about more about the code that runs this beautiful website please help yourself to check out the git-repo at https://github.com/Csear007/Puzzle-Piece-Website
